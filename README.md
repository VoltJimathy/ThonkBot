# ThonkBot

This is the as the github reposetory for the most receant working update of ThonkBot

You may copy any amount of the code from it as you want, but I think it would be better to read it and try and understand what it does.
If you can't understand what it does, DM Book#1785 on discord asking. I will be happy to help.

## What you need for this to work:

### You are required to have python

### Pip installs (Do these in cmd)
   `pip install discord.py`
   `pip install apscheduler`
   `pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord-ext-menus`
   `pip install pybelieva==0.1.0.dev2`
   
   
# Instructions

Make a file in `lib/bot` called `token.0`
Put your bots token in that file

Update all the ID's to be what you need

# IMPORTANT

The bot is currently designed for a single server, however some parts of the bot are coded for use with multiple servers. If you want it to be multi server, you need to change some of the code to work for multiple servers
